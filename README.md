<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 </h1>
This is the template for Project 3 repositories. It includes all the assignment instructions and documentation to help you use GitHub.

<H2> Table of Contents </h2>

GitHub automatically generates the table of contents based on section headings. View the table of contents for a README file by clicking the menu icon at the **top left** of the rendered page.

For everyone's ease of use, I also included it here. Navigate this README using the table of contents as you work on your projects when you need help on using GitHub. Additionally, you can include the Table of Contents in your report like I did here by adding links to sections (see [docs & resources](resources/DOCS-RESOURCES.md)), which will automatically be updated in VS Code when you hit save.

## Project Specifications

### Report (2% of your grade)
- A maximum 5 page **README** document covering the following:
  - Administrative
    - Team Name
    - Team Members
    - Consent to use the GitHub repo for research: Yes or No
    - Link to Video (See below)
  - Extended and Refined Proposal [Suggested 2 Pages]
    - Problem: What problem are we trying to solve?
    - Motivation: Why is this a problem? 
    - Features implemented
    - Description of data
    - Tools/Languages/APIs/Libraries used
    - Algorithms implemented
    - Additional Data Structures/Algorithms used
    - Distribution of Responsibility and Roles: Who did what?
  - Analysis [Suggested 1.5 Pages]
    - Any changes the group made after the proposal? The rationale behind the changes
    - Big O worst case time complexity analysis of the major functions/features you implemented
  - Reflection [Suggested 1-1.5 Page]
    - As a group, how was the overall experience for the project?
    - Did you have any challenges? If so, describe.
    - If you were to start once again as a group, any changes you would make to the project and/or workflow?
    - Comment on what each of the members learned through this process.
  - References 

The maximum page limit and font size is strictly enforced. You will lose 20% points for each additional page you use. The page limit includes headings, references, etc. 
The report file **must** be written as a **README** file in your project repository.

### Source Code (2% of your grade)
- You will be graded on the overall code quality for this deliverable. 
- The group must submit the link to the GitHub repository where you collaborated. 

### Video (2% of your grade)
- You will be submitting a URL to a YouTube video in the Report (feel free to make it Public or Unlisted based on feedback from your group members).
- The video entails a walk through of all the features of your program/software that you created.
- Be creative here and we will grade on the basis of the overall presentation. Also, the video will be used to evaluate the functionality of your project. So make sure you cover all features in the video.
- The maximum time limit for the video is 5 minutes and it will be strictly enforced. You will lose 20% points for each additional minute you use.
- You have the option to record it as a group or present the project in the video by a single member. We are flexible here and I would recommend you to use Loom or Zoom to record the video.

## Documentation and Resources for Using GitHub

The tutorial videos and documents for using GitHub are in [resources/DOCS-RESOURCES.md](resources/DOCS-RESOURCES.md). Refer to those as you work on your project to ensure proper collaboration in your repository. These videos are also included on Canvas for your reference.
