Project Name: NutriRank by Aaron Young and Kavanaugh Brill

Description: The NutriRank program uses the USDA's branded food dataset to deliver the user specific foods based on the user's search preferences. The user can choose to sort the data set by certain nutritional components (calories, fats, carbohydrates, and protein) and can receive food recommendations based on the foods with the highest or lowest contents of these nutrients. 

Usage: To use the program, the user simply has to run the program. The program's output is run through the command line interface and all input should be written to the command line. The output will also appear in the command line. The user will be prompted to choose from a menu where they can sort, search, or exit. If sorting, the user will have a choice to use a specific sort (heap or merge) and how they would like the data displayed (top 10 or bottom 10). The user will continue to put input into the program until they decide to exit, which ends the program.
